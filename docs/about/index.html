For a long time, his primary interest was in technologies from Microsoft: core technologies like Windows, Office, .NET,SharePoint, SQL Server et al as well as lesser-known things like MSI installers, Windows CE Platform Builder and Services for UNIX. From 2016 onwards, he switched focus completely to open-source technologies, with special emphasis on containerization and orchestration.</p><ul><li>Email him on: <a href=mailto:raj@rajware.net>raj@rajware.net</a></li><li>Hit him up on Github: <a href=https://github.com/rajch>@rajch</a></li></ul><hr></div></section><section class="container-fluid footer_section"><p>Copyright &copy; 2022- All Rights Reserved By Rajware Services Pvt.
