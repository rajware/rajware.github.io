All our training programs are built around these two ideas. We also believe that the best way to learn a technology is to use it. Thus, all our trainings are hands-on. After a initial section where we discuss the motivation of any technology, the rest of the training is completely practical.</description></item><item><title>Consulting</title><link>http://rajware.github.io/services/consulting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 16:46:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://rajware.github.io/services/consulting/</guid><description>We provide consulting services to product and service-oriented organizations, in the specific areas of project scoping, design and architecture review, application performance and scaling, and team capabality.
