All our training programs are built around these two ideas. We also believe that the best way to learn a technology is to use it. Thus, all our trainings are hands-on. After a initial section where we discuss the motivation of any technology, the rest of the training is completely practical.</p><p>Our courses are carefully designed to help you understand core ideas, and enable you to explore further on your own, as well as apply the learning in your daily work. The learning is incremental, with each section building on previous ones, and exercises complementing each other. Finally, the courses and exercises are created using our practical experience of the relevant technology, and official documentation from the creators/maintainers of said technology.</p><h2 id=courses>Courses</h2><p>We currently offer the following courses:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Course</th><th>Duration</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Containerization with Docker</td><td>5 days</td><td>This course teaches the concept of containerization as standardized by the OCI, and as implemented by Docker.
