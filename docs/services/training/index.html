    <div class="container "><img src="/services/training/images/icon.png" alt="Training" class="content_icon" /><h1>Training</h1><p>We believe that to use any technology effectively, you have to first understand the motivation (why) behind its creation, and then its basic design (what). This makes understanding the utilisation (how) easy and intuitive. We also believe that the best way to learn a technology is to try it as you learn it. Therefore, all our trainings are deliberately hands-on. All our training programs are built around these ideas. After an initial section where we discuss the motivation and design of any technology, the rest of the training is completely practical - to better understand the utilisation.</p>
<p>Our courses are carefully designed to help you understand core concepts first, and thus enable you to explore further on your own and apply the learning in your daily business/project needs. The learning is incremental: topics building on previous ones, exercises complementing each other, samples mirroring real-life scenarios. Finally, the courses and exercises are created using our practical experience of the relevant technology, and official product documentation.</p>
