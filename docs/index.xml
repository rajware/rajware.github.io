      <description>We believe that to use any technology effectively, you have to first understand the motivation (why) behind its creation, and then its basic design (what). This makes understanding the utilisation (how) easy and intuitive. We also believe that the best way to learn a technology is to try it as you learn it. Therefore, all our trainings are deliberately hands-on. All our training programs are built around these ideas. After an initial section where we discuss the motivation and design of any technology, the rest of the training is completely practical - to better understand the utilisation.</description>
