We strongly believe in Open Source. Most of our training courses are built on open-source technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Go, and so on. Our standard course content, samples, and tools that we have built to deliver these courses, are all open source. They are available under the MIT License on [Github](https://github.com/rajware).

We created a cross-platform tool for setting up Kubernetes clusters, and also created some Kubernetes add-ons to complement it. We spun off these tools as an independent open-source project called [kuttiproject](https://github.com/kuttiproject).

We participate in open source projects created by others as well, in some cases as maintainers. We also provide consulting on managing open source codebases and license compliance.
