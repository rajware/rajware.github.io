We strongly believe in Open Source. Most of our training courses are built on open-source technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Go, and so on. 

Our standard course content, as well as tools that we have built to deliver these courses, are all available under the MIT License on [Github](https://github.com/rajware).

We spun off a tool that we originally built as an aid to our Kubernetes work as an independent open-source project called [kuttiproject](https://github.com/kuttiproject).

We also provide consulting on managing open source codebases and license compliance.
