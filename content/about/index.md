{{< figure src="/images/raj.png" title="Raj" width="240px" >}}Raj Chaudhuri started his career in 1991, as a teacher in a computer training institute. He then moved on to software development, and kept moving. He has designed and developed software, led teams, co-founded organizations, served on leadership teams, set up practices, and been a prolific speaker at events. He did this both as an independent professional, and during stints at organizations like Maestros Mediline, Aditi Technologies and Microsoft India.

Through all this, he held on to his teaching roots, by conducting training programs whenever he could. In 2017, he resigned as the CTO of Asymmetrique, and returned to full-time training and consulting.

Raj has always been interested in deeply exploring technology, and making it easily accessible to others. For a long time, his primary interest was in technologies from Microsoft: core technologies like Windows, Office, .NET,SharePoint, SQL Server et al as well as lesser-known things like MSI installers, Windows CE Platform Builder and Services for UNIX. From 2016 onwards, he switched focus completely to open-source technologies, with special emphasis on containerization and orchestration.
